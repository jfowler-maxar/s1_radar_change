search_for_gran.py​
First script to run, setups work directories ​
Need Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem account for access​
Search Parameters:​
  Tile: for directory organization, I like to break things into 1x1 geocells. Also determines bounding box ​
  ProductType: IW_GRDH, stands for Interferometric Wide Swatch and Ground Range Detected Resolution. Main mode of acquisition  ​
  Polarization: VV, Wave mode, vertical transmit – vertical receive ​
  Pass: either "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING", this can be removed from search parameters, I like to include it when searching for specific relative orbits​
  Loops by month and searches for Sentinel 1 scenes that fit parameters. There's probably a smarter way to code this​
Outputs multiple csv files:​
One csv for each month, result of monthly search from parameters​
A csv named "{tile}_id.csv" that contains a list of all S1 scenes that meet parameters ​

Find_rel_orbs.py​
Pretty simple, takes "{tile}_id.csv" from previous script and creates a separate csv file for each relative orbit  ​
